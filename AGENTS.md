## RULE 0 - THE FUNDAMENTAL OVERRIDE PREROGATIVE

If I tell you to do something, even if it goes against what follows below, YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME. I AM IN CHARGE, NOT YOU.

---

## RULE 0.5 - SUITE-WIDE RULES LIVE IN /data/projects/AGENTS.md

The suite-wide rules in **`/data/projects/AGENTS.md`** bind you here too. Read it. Two sections
are load-bearing for perf work and are NOT duplicated below, so they cannot drift out of sync:

- **`## Named Reward-Hacking Patterns (ALL FORBIDDEN)`** — 12 named patterns, several already
  observed in this suite: gate self-weakening (and the exact price of a legitimate gate fix),
  proof-class inflation, golden regeneration reflex, commit-stream pumping, tautological tests,
  easy-lever cherry-picking, close-pump abuse, scope-splitting, spec-editing as progress,
  conformance metastasis, dependency smuggling, bench-path hardcoding.
- **`### Work-Graph Discipline`** — JSONL is truth and `beads.db` is disposable, `br sync
  --import-only` after every pull, single-writer on graph structure, closure on cited evidence
  with blocker beads gated on their named probe, `br dep cycles` stays empty.

The three that most often decide whether a number here is real: a **self-speedup is
MAINTENANCE, not a win** — a win needs the incumbent live in the SAME invocation; **never
weaken a gate to land a change**, and if a gate is genuinely defective, meet the evidence
standard and publish the win/lose split of what the fix admits; and **reporting a loss is a
success** — one line, revert, next lever, no retraction narrative.

---

## RULE NUMBER 1: NO FILE DELETION

**YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO DELETE A FILE WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION.** Even a new file that you yourself created, such as a test code file. You have a horrible track record of deleting critically important files or otherwise throwing away tons of expensive work. As a result, you have permanently lost any and all rights to determine that a file or folder should be deleted.

**YOU MUST ALWAYS ASK AND RECEIVE CLEAR, WRITTEN PERMISSION BEFORE EVER DELETING A FILE OR FOLDER OF ANY KIND.**

---

## Irreversible Git & Filesystem Actions — DO NOT EVER BREAK GLASS

1. **Absolutely forbidden commands:** `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `rm -rf`, or any command that can delete or overwrite code/data must never be run unless the user explicitly provides the exact command and states, in the same message, that they understand and want the irreversible consequences.
2. **No guessing:** If there is any uncertainty about what a command might delete or overwrite, stop immediately and ask the user for specific approval. "I think it's safe" is never acceptable.
3. **Safer alternatives first:** When cleanup or rollbacks are needed, request permission to use non-destructive options (`git status`, `git diff`, `git stash`, copying to backups) before ever considering a destructive command.
4. **Mandatory explicit plan:** Even after explicit user authorization, restate the command verbatim, list exactly what will be affected, and wait for a confirmation that your understanding is correct. Only then may you execute it—if anything remains ambiguous, refuse and escalate.
5. **Document the confirmation:** When running any approved destructive command, record (in the session notes / final response) the exact user text that authorized it, the command actually run, and the execution time. If that record is absent, the operation did not happen.

---

## Git Branch: ONLY Use `main`, NEVER `master`

**The default branch is `main`. The `master` branch exists only for legacy URL compatibility.**

- **All work happens on `main`** — commits, PRs, feature branches all merge to `main`
- **Never reference `master` in code or docs** — if you see `master` anywhere, it's a bug that needs fixing
- **The `master` branch must stay synchronized with `main`** — after pushing to `main`, also push to `master`:
  ```bash
  git push origin main:master
  ```

**If you see `master` referenced anywhere:**
1. Update it to `main`
2. Ensure `master` is synchronized: `git push origin main:master`

---

## Toolchain: Rust & Cargo

We only use **Cargo** in this project, NEVER any other package manager.

- **Edition:** Rust 2024 (nightly required — see `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- **Dependency versions:** Explicit versions for stability
- **Configuration:** Cargo.toml workspace with `workspace = true` pattern
- **Unsafe code:** Forbidden (`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`) across all numeric and symbolic core crates. Any PyO3 boundary is strictly isolated.

### Async Runtime: asupersync (MANDATORY — NO TOKIO)

**This project uses [asupersync](/dp/asupersync) exclusively for all async/concurrent operations. Tokio and the entire tokio ecosystem are FORBIDDEN.**

- **Structured concurrency**: `Cx`, `Scope`, `region()` — no orphan tasks
- **Cancel-correct channels**: Two-phase `reserve()/send()` — no data loss on cancellation
- **Sync primitives**: `asupersync::sync::Mutex`, `RwLock`, `OnceCell`, `Pool` — cancel-aware
- **Deterministic testing**: `LabRuntime` with virtual time, DPOR, oracles

**Forbidden crates**: `tokio`, `hyper`, `reqwest`, `axum`, `tower` (tokio adapter), `async-std`, `smol`, or any crate that transitively depends on tokio.

---

## Code Editing Discipline

### No Script-Based Changes

**NEVER** run a script that processes/changes code files in this repo. Brittle regex-based transformations create far more problems than they solve.

- **Always make code changes manually**, even when there are many instances
- For many simple changes: use parallel subagents
- For subtle/complex changes: do them methodically yourself

### No File Proliferation

If you want to change something or add a feature, **revise existing code files in place**.

**NEVER** create variations like:
- `mainV2.rs`
- `main_improved.rs`
- `main_enhanced.rs`

New files are reserved for **genuinely new functionality** that makes zero sense to include in any existing file. The bar for creating new files is **incredibly high**.

---

## Backwards Compatibility

We do not care about backwards compatibility—we're in early development with no users. We want to do things the **RIGHT** way with **NO TECH DEBT**.

- Never create "compatibility shims"
- Never create wrapper functions for deprecated APIs
- Just fix the code directly

---

## Compiler Checks (CRITICAL)

**After any substantive code changes, you MUST verify no errors were introduced:**

```bash
# Check for compiler errors and warnings (workspace-wide)
cargo check --workspace --all-targets

# Check for clippy lints
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Verify formatting
cargo fmt --check
```

---

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests across the workspace
cargo test --workspace

# Run with output
cargo test --workspace -- --nocapture
```

---

## FrankenSymPy — This Project

FrankenSymPy is a clean-room, memory-safe Rust reimplementation of SymPy (Python's library for symbolic mathematics and computer algebra systems).

### Core Architectural Principles

1. **Memory-Safe Clean-Room Symbolic Engine:** `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` on symbolic and algebraic cores.
2. **Differential Conformance Against SymPy:** Continuous verification against upstream SymPy reference outputs.
3. **Structured Async & Resource Bounding:** Using `asupersync` for deterministic timeouts and evaluation budgets.

## MCP Agent Mail — Multi-Agent Coordination

Coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources.

- Single source of truth: Beads for task status/priority/dependencies; Agent Mail for conversation and audit
- Use Beads issue ID (e.g. `br-123`) as Mail `thread_id` and prefix subjects with `[br-123]`
- Reserve edit surface with `file_reservation_paths` before modifying files.

---

## Beads (br) — Dependency-Aware Issue Tracking

This project uses [beads_rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (`br`) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

```bash
br ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open # All open issues
br show <id>          # Full issue details
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason "Completed"
br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL
```

---

## bv — Graph-Aware Triage Engine

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (`.beads/beads.jsonl`).

```bash
bv --robot-triage     # Start here for triage
bv --robot-next       # Top pick + claim command
```

---

## UBS — Ultimate Bug Scanner

**Golden Rule:** `ubs <changed-files>` before every commit. Exit 0 = safe. Exit >0 = fix & re-run.

---

## RCH — Remote Compilation Helper

RCH offloads `cargo build`, `cargo test`, and `cargo clippy` to remote workers to prevent local overload.

```bash
rch exec -- cargo check
rch exec -- cargo test
```

---

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

When ending a work session, you MUST complete ALL steps below:

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues in Beads for follow-ups
2. **Run quality gates** - Tests, linters, formatting
3. **Update issue status** - Close completed items
4. **Sync beads** - `br sync --flush-only` to export to JSONL
5. **Stage and commit cleanly**
6. **Sync main to master** (`git push origin main:master`)
